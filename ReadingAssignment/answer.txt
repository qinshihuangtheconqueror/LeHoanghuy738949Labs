1. The class that should implement the 'Comparable' interface is 'Media'

2. @Override
    public int compareTo(Media other) {
        int titleComparison = this.title.compareTo(other.title);
        if (titleComparison != 0) {
            return titleComparison;
        }
        return Float.compare(other.cost, title.cost);
    }

and same goes for sorting by cost then title

3. No. We should use Comparator thenComparing method.

4. We should override the compare method in DVD which is inherited from Media
